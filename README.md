# Project: ToGo-list using mapBox gl

## Solution:

1.	I started to access token.  I got token key after I registered from mapbox.com using free plan.
2.	I also used mapbox style url.
3.	I also understand in documentation that I need to use geojson data. I created using mapbox studio.
4.	In my project i made geojson file with properties and 14 countries.
5.	I got tips from mapbox example and build my project with my own geojson data and I succeed to show the map with my geojson image marks.
6.	After that I research how make to do list. I found an example that makes to do list of all my data. I do that and I get 14 countries in my to do list. But it was not what I wanted. I want to click and confirm and show to the list.
I tried to make mapbox popup clickable to confirm and add to the list but not succeeded.
Then I searched another alternative and find function get value.
Then I fixed the code in the function that load all data files ToGo list so it’s only load one and also load input text.
7.	Then I found example how to click ToGo list. I coded in my script.js file. First, I got problem with this because It only show the first index and caught error after the second index. After many hours of testing I found the error. And it was so very little to change.

## Remaining work:

1.	User can remove from ToGo list.
I have started and style but I still under work because I don’t have much time.
My plan to do is to create remove button in ToGo list. When you click on the button which item in the list you want to remove.
2.	I want also to work on design to make my project looks fancy and also my code to have a clean and understandable code.
